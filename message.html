        So, I‚Äôd been ruminating on this for a while, and before i go any further, I want to apologize for my ineptitude in
        writing üòÇ, and whatever corniness you might find in this.
        It‚Äôs been exactly 9 months since i first got that text from you, and as you may well know, i don‚Äôt believe in destiny,
        but bloody hell did life not turn you from the person i barely notice, to one of the few people i genuinely care about
        in this world üòÇ ... These past 9 months have been awful for everyone, it‚Äôs taking a toll on the mental health of
        everyone and we all needed an anchor. (I was watching the world burn , and all i could think about was you) .Thank you
        for being my anchor, thank you for keeping me sane all these months, thank you for sitting wherever you are and
        listening to all my shit talk, thank you for putting up with my stupidity whenever it comes out (I know, it‚Äôs a lot, i
        can‚Äôt seem to help it) thank you for believing in me, thank you for not binning me(I have no idea what I‚Äôll do if you do
        that) thank you for being amazing Oreoluwa. I want you to have an amazing birthday, it pains me that I‚Äôm not there to
        share this special day with you, but i'll manage technology to be available in whatever way i can There‚Äôs nothing more
        I‚Äôd want to do right now than to give you a giant hug, and deliver this message to you physically...
        Thank you for being a great person, cheers to many more birthdays for you I hope you find as much joy in reading this as
        i did in writing this .... Happy birthday Oreoluwa, I love you.... See you soon
        Your‚Äôs sincerely
        Your Private Dancer
       <p class="text-center mssg"> P.S: I wrote all this myself.. Yay... And there might be a website just for you for a day..... I hope you find joy in
        that too üòò</p>
     <p class="text-center mssg">P.P.S: I really hope you change your mind about hugging me, i have a fuck ton of hugs to give üëè</p>
